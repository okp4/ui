# OKP4 Faucet

> Allows anyone to request tokens for a [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) account address (on testnets).

[![stability-unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/emersion/stability-badges#unstable)

## Description

The `Faucet` is a complete organism that brings to the user an interface allowing him to request tokens (issued on a testnet) sent to a Cosmos address - entered directly or retrieved from the Keplr wallet.

The organism embeds all the business logic, including the connection to the Keplr wallet and the management of request for tokens sent to the [Faucet service](https://github.com/okp4/cosmos-faucet).

For the OKP4 testnets, the Faucet service is configured to send 1 KNOW per request, with a maximum of 1 request each 5 seconds. To get some KNOWs, you just need to enter your OKP4 address or connect via [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap), the OKP4 wallet!

  }}
</Story>

## Usage

To configure the organism, the [@okp4/ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okp4/ui) library provides all the necessary elements. You will just have to follow these 3 steps:

### 1. Create a `config.json` file that declares the COSMOS blockchain configuration

This file contains all the information the organism needs to configure itself:
- the identifier of the COSMOS blockchain (aka the `chainId`).
- the URL of the [Faucet service](https://github.com/okp4/cosmos-faucet) endpoint on the backend. This service supports any Cosmos based blockchain and is available for the OKP4 testnets networks.
- the complete description of the blockchain for the registration on Keplr. This is required to request adding new Cosmos-SDK based blockchains that isn't natively integrated to Keplr extension.

The following `config.json` file is a configuration example for connecting to the `okp4-devnet-1` network.

**`config.json`**

<Source code={JSON.stringify(env.default, null, 2)} language='json'/>

### 2. Instanciate redux stores to init the component

To work, the component uses [redux](https://redux.js.org/) as a state manager and an `eventBus` instance to facilitate communication between the business domains.  

To do this, all you have to do is declare the store parameters in a `store.ts` file to be able to import them later into a `Provider` component that will take care of injecting them into the React context.

**`store.ts`**

```ts
import { List } from 'immutable'
import {
  createEventBusInstance,
  HTTPFaucetGateway,
  ErrorStoreBuilder,
  FaucetStoreBuilder,
  FaucetContext,
  ErrorContext,
  KeplrWalletGateway,
  TaskContext,
  TaskStoreBuilder,
  WalletContext,
  WalletRegistryGateway,
  WalletStoreBuilder
} from '@okp4/ui'
import type { StoreParameter } from '@okp4/ui'
import * as config from './config.json'

/** Init an eventBus instance
 * Needed to enable communication and reactivity beetwen business domains
 */
const eventBusInstance = createEventBusInstance()

/** Init Faucet Gateway & redux store
 * The heart of Faucet behaviour
 */
const faucetGateway = new HTTPFaucetGateway(config.faucetUrl)
const faucetStore = new FaucetStoreBuilder()
  .withEventBus(eventBusInstance)
  .withDependencies({ faucetGateway })
  .build()
const faucetStoreParameter: StoreParameter = [FaucetContext, faucetStore]

/** Init Error redux store
 * Needed to handle errors thrown by other domains
 */
const errorStore = new ErrorStoreBuilder().withEventBus(eventBusInstance).build()
const errorStoreParameter: StoreParameter = [ErrorContext, errorStore]

/** Init Task redux store
 * Needed to handle asynchronous tasks fired by other domains
 */
const taskStore = new TaskStoreBuilder().withEventBus(eventBusInstance).build()
const taskStoreParameter: StoreParameter = [TaskContext, taskStore]

/** Init Wallet Gateway & redux store
 * Needed to handle Keplr wallet
 */
const walletRegistryGateway = new WalletRegistryGateway()
const keplrGateway = new KeplrWalletGateway(config.kepkrChainInfo)
walletRegistryGateway.register(keplrGateway)
const walletStore = new WalletStoreBuilder()
  .withEventBus(eventBusInstance)
  .withDependencies({ walletRegistryGateway })
  .build()
const walletStoreParameter: StoreParameter = [WalletContext, walletStore]

/** Export store parameters as following: [StoreContext, StoreInstance]
 * Will be auto-injected in React context through <StoreProvider> props
 */
export default List([
  faucetStoreParameter,
  errorStoreParameter,
  walletStoreParameter,
  taskStoreParameter
])
```

### 3. Wrap the `Faucet` component into a store provider

Finally, it is necessary to wrap the `Faucet` component in a `StoreProvider` which will auto-inject into the React context the configuration elements necessary for its proper functioning.

This `StoreProvider` component is directly provided by the `@okp4/ui` library, you simply have to pass it the parameters exported by the `store.ts` file as properties.

**`app.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Faucet, StoreProvider } from '@okp4/ui'
import * as storeParameters from './store'
import * as config from './config.json'

export const App: React.FC = () => (
  <StoreProvider storeParameters={storeParameters}>
    <Faucet chainId={config.chainId} />
  </StoreProvider>
)
```

And, that's it!
You have to create or import an account within Keplr extension and everything else is handled by the component itself 🚀

## Notes

- Keep in mind that the Faucet is intended to be used on `testnet` environments.
- The Keplr extension is only available for now in Chrome browser, watch out for other extensions with the same name but which are scams trying to access your mnemonics...
- This tool is an opensource project offered to the community, feel free to visit the official [Faucet](https://github.com/okp4/faucet-web) GitHub for a more polished example and contribute if you have any feature ideas or a bug to fix!
